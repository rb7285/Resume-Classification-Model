# 🧠 ResumeClassifier – Intelligent Resume Classification using NLP + ML

## 📌 Project Overview
**ResumeClassifier** is an NLP-based machine learning project that automatically classifies resumes into job categories like **Data Science**, **Web Development**, **HR**, etc. By processing raw text from resumes and applying classification algorithms, this tool streamlines the candidate screening process for recruiters and HR teams.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Extract relevant content from resume text using NLP preprocessing.
- ✅ Convert text into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- ✅ Train ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to classify resumes by domain.
- ✅ Evaluate and optimize model accuracy using cross-validation and confusion matrix.
- ✅ Build a user-friendly interface to test and visualize predictions.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Collection:** Dataset of resumes labeled by job category (e.g., Data Scientist, Web Developer, HR).
2. **Preprocessing:**
   - Text cleaning (lowercasing, punctuation removal)
   - Tokenization, stopword removal
   - Lemmatization
3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer to convert resume text into numerical vectors
4. **Model Training:**
   - Tried multiple classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest
   - Final model selected based on F1-score and accuracy
5. **Evaluation:** Confusion matrix, precision-recall analysis
6. **(Optional)** GUI using Streamlit or Flask for real-time classification
